    <p>What is the difference between Git, GitHub and GitHub desktop?</p>
    <h2>Git</h2>
    <p>
      Git is a version control software that tracks the changes made to files
      and simplifies collaboration. Git runs locally.
    </p>
    <h2>GitHub</h2>
    <p>
      GitHub, on the other hand, is a website where you can remotely store your
      Git project repositories to make it accessible for anyone working on the
      project.
    </p>
    <h2>GitHub desktop</h2>
    <p>
      GitHub desktop is an easy to use application that runs Git on your
      computer and allows you to do most of the Git command line commands,
      throught a more visual program interface. It allows us to add all of our
      projects onto our GitHub account.
